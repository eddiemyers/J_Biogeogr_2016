R scripts for RDA

The R script and example fasta file and locality data can be used to recreate the redundancy analyses in Myers et al. Journal of Biogeography paper ( https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12873). This allows you to test associations between population genetic structure and geographic distances, biogeographic barriers, or climatic variables.
